# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client is built with React 18 and TypeScript, styled using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components. It functions as a single-page application (SPA) with client-side routing via Wouter. TanStack Query manages server state, while React hooks handle local state, ensuring a modular structure of pages, components, hooks, and utilities.

## Backend Architecture
The backend uses Express.js with TypeScript in ESM mode, providing a RESTful API for game operations. It operates on a dual-server architecture:
- **Main Server**: `server/index.ts` (port 5000) handles core game APIs and token operations.
- **Admin Server**: `admin-panel/server/admin-server.ts` (port 3002) manages admin panel functionalities.
Both servers access the same Drizzle ORM instance connected to a PostgreSQL database.

**IMPORTANT**: The admin server runs independently and is essential for admin panel functionality. Module resolution is configured in `admin-panel/tsconfig.json` with `@shared/*` path mapping.

## Data Storage Solutions
Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL (hosted on Neon Database) is used for persistent data storage. The schema includes tables for Players, Upgrades, Achievements, Token Burns, and Referrals. Player data includes Solana wallet integration fields.

## Solana Integration & Wallet Management
The application implements a security-first, one-time wallet linking system. Users link their Solana wallet addresses (via Web UI, Telegram Bot, or Discord Bot) without granting direct wallet permissions. This prevents exploitation by disallowing multiple wallet changes, ensuring one wallet per account and per user across platforms. Real Solana token `devwuNsNYACyiEYxRNqMNseBpNnGfnd4ZwNHL3sphqv` is used with a manual distribution system and live balance verification.

## Authentication and Authorization
A basic session-based system using localStorage identifies players through auto-generated usernames. The system is designed for future expansion to more robust authentication.

## Feature Specifications
- **Comprehensive Marketplace Economy**: Features 12 authentic cannabis strains with varied pricing and yield bonuses, spanning from budget to premium items.
- **Advanced Staking Economy**: Offers 5 active pools with APY rates from 8% to 35% across 30 to 365-day durations, with minimum stake requirements and auto-compounding.
- **Tournament & Competition Systems**: Includes 3 active tournaments with entry fees and large prize pools, alongside guild wars for territory control and competitive leaderboards.
- **Daily Bonus & Loyalty System**: Provides progressive streak rewards with a 20-hour cooldown and loyalty point tracking.
- **Comprehensive Achievement System**: Features 20 achievements across garden, social, marketplace, and KUSH milestone categories with progressive difficulty.
- **Global Events & Seasonal Content**: Incorporates 3 active seasonal events (e.g., Harvest Moon Festival, KUSH Rush Hour, Green Friday Sales) with dynamic multipliers and limited-time rewards.
- **Enhanced Social Features**: Includes friend gift systems, squad farming bonuses, party clicking rewards, and loyalty multipliers.
- **Manual Token Economy**: Utilizes Solana token `devwuNsNYACyiEYxRNqMNseBpNnGfnd4ZwNHL3sphqv` with manual distribution for achievements, marketplace, staking, and tournament rewards, managed via an admin panel with live balance checking.
- **Token Burning & Grow Light System**: Allows players to burn real tokens via linked wallets. Features 14 grow light types providing passive KUSH and click multipliers, verified on-chain.
- **Advanced Admin Panel**: Complete management interface with tab navigation (Analytics, Players, Token Payouts, Notifications, System), real-time notifications, bulk operations, and persistent authentication.
